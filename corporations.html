    <h2>Hierarchy in Corporations</h2>
   <ul>
  <li><strong>1.</strong> Hierarchies go back thousands of years—to monarchies, empires, and religious institutions.</li>
  <li><strong>2.</strong> Many people are taught to respect authority and follow leaders without question.</li>
  <li><strong>3.</strong> Hierarchical systems appear “natural” to many due to how society is structured (school, jobs, law).</li>
  <li><strong>4.</strong> Governments are slow to change due to legal limits, gridlock, and deep bureaucracy.</li>
  <li><strong>5.</strong> Corporations are protected under U.S. law as “legal persons,” giving them rights like free speech.</li>
  <li><strong>6.</strong> The rich and powerful can afford lawyers, lobbyists, and media influence to keep control.</li>
  <li><strong>7.</strong> Breaking up large systems is complex, risky, and expensive—so change is avoided.</li>
  <li><strong>8.</strong> Technology and automation sometimes strengthen hierarchy by concentrating control in fewer hands.</li>
  <li><strong>9.</strong> Globalization has made corporations even more powerful, able to shift jobs and avoid regulation.</li>
  <li><strong>10.</strong> People may feel powerless or too busy to organize against large-scale hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
