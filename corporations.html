    <h2>Hierarchy in Corporations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.</strong> Corporations follow strict hierarchies—CEO at the top, middle managers, and employees at the base.</li>
      <li><strong>2.</strong> Boards of Directors, often wealthy insiders, make high-level decisions most workers never see.</li>
      <li><strong>3.</strong> Executives prioritize shareholders over workers or the environment—this is called "shareholder primacy."</li>
      <li><strong>4.</strong> The top 1% in the U.S. hold over 30% of the nation's wealth, partly due to corporate structures.</li>
      <li><strong>5.</strong> Corporations use their power to lobby for laws that benefit them—Amazon, Apple, and Meta spend millions annually.</li>
      <li><strong>6.</strong> Worker voices are often silenced or ignored, especially in non-union environments.</li>
      <li><strong>7.</strong> Corporate consolidation (mergers and acquisitions) reduces competition and increases centralized control.</li>
      <li><strong>8.</strong> Executive pay has skyrocketed: CEOs make 300–400 times more than the average worker in many firms.</li>
      <li><strong>9.</strong> Multinational corporations operate across borders, often bypassing national regulations and exploiting global labor.</li>
    </ul>
