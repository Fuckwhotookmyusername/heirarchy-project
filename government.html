    <h2>🔍 Government Facts</h2>

    <ul class="fact-list">
      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>1.</strong> Government hierarchy is top-down and slow to change.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Power is typically held by a small group of elected or appointed officials. The structure rarely allows for quick input from citizens at lower levels.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>2.</strong> The three-branch system reinforces slow decision-making.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          The U.S. government separates power into the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, which can lead to gridlock and make hierarchy harder to challenge.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>3.</strong> Lobbying gives corporations more influence than voters.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Large companies spend millions on lobbying to push laws in their favor. This can give them more power than everyday citizens in shaping legislation.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>4.</strong> Only the wealthy can realistically run for high office.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Political campaigns are extremely expensive, making it hard for average people to enter national politics without big financial backing.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>5.</strong> Unequal representation reduces public voice.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Gerrymandering and voting restrictions can make certain groups underrepresented, while others hold disproportionate power.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>6.</strong> Bureaucracies are built to maintain order — not flexibility.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Government agencies often focus on maintaining existing structures, making innovation or decentralization difficult.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>7.</strong> Supreme Court decisions can lock in hierarchical rules.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Important rulings — like Citizens United — have increased corporate influence, reinforcing top-down power structures.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>8.</strong> Many laws protect those already in power.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Incumbents often benefit from policies and structures that discourage reform or the rise of challengers.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>9.</strong> Local governments often mirror federal hierarchy.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Even in cities and school boards, decisions are often made by a few, with limited community input or accountability.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>10.</strong> Cultural respect for authority can block change.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Many people grow up believing that government authority should not be questioned, which can reduce grassroots efforts to shift power.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
