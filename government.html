    <h2>Hierarchy in Government</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.</strong> Most governments are structured with top-down authority—executives, legislatures, and courts at the top.</li>
      <li><strong>2.</strong> This setup mirrors monarchies and colonial rule, where a few controlled the many.</li>
      <li><strong>3.</strong> Even in democracies, political elites dominate elections due to money, media, and connections.</li>
      <li><strong>4.</strong> Large bureaucracies enforce policies, but they often move slowly and are hard to reform.</li>
      <li><strong>5.</strong> Lobbyists and special interest groups influence legislation, often more than everyday voters.</li>
      <li><strong>6.</strong> The Electoral College and gerrymandering in the U.S. reduce direct representation.</li>
      <li><strong>7.</strong> Citizens technically have voting power, but systemic barriers like voter suppression still exist.</li>
      <li><strong>8.</strong> Laws and constitutions rarely allow average people to directly participate in lawmaking.</li>
      <li><strong>9.</strong> Politicians often stay in power for decades, reinforcing hierarchical continuity.</li>
    </ul>
