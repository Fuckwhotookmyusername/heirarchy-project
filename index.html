        <div class="fact-detail">
          <p>Government hierarchies exist at local, state, and federal levels. Each tier has different responsibilities, like law enforcement, budgeting, and policy-making. These structures can sometimes create inefficiencies but also allow for control and coordination across large populations.</p>

        <button class="fact-btn" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Corporations dominate the global economy.</button>
        <div class="fact-detail">
          <p>Multinational corporations such as Amazon and Apple generate more revenue than some countries. Their top-down structure centralizes power in the hands of CEOs and boards, allowing them to influence markets, labor laws, and even governments through lobbying and economic pressure.</p>

      <li class="fact-item">
        <button class="fact-btn" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Wealth inequality grows under hierarchy.</button>
        <div class="fact-detail">
          <p>Corporate and political hierarchies often reinforce wealth gaps. Executives earn hundreds of times more than their workers, and policies tend to favor the rich due to their greater access and influence in high places. This makes it difficult to shift power dynamics.</p>
