      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p><strong>Project Question:</strong> Why has there been no rule set to stop hierarchy in government and the economy—including big business—and why has it lasted so long?</p>
      <p>This site explores the roots, impact, and potential solutions to unchecked power and hierarchy in modern systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gov">
      <h2>Government Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Governments are built with layers of power—from presidents to local officials. This hierarchy is deeply rooted in historical power structures and protected by systems like electoral control, political party dominance, and legal complexity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="corp">
      <h2>Corporate Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>In the economy, major corporations are dominated by top executives and shareholders. Wealth and power are concentrated at the top, with little accountability. Mergers, monopolies, and lobbying strengthen their influence and block reforms.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why It Lasts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>History:</strong> Hierarchy has been the default structure in most civilizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Law & Politics:</strong> Rules often protect the powerful (corporate personhood, weak antitrust enforcement).</li>
        <li><strong>Money & Influence:</strong> Rich individuals and companies fund campaigns and write laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Acceptance:</strong> Many see hierarchy as “normal” or necessary.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="solutions">
      <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>

        <li>Promoting unions and worker cooperatives</li>
        <li>More public control and transparency in politics</li>
