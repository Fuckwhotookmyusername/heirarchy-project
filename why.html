    <h2>🔍 Why Hierarchies Last</h2>

    <ul class="fact-list">
      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>1.</strong> People are taught to accept authority from a young age.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          School systems, workplaces, and families often teach obedience over questioning, reinforcing the idea that power structures are natural or necessary.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>2.</strong> Fear of instability discourages change.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Even when people dislike the system, the fear of chaos or economic collapse often leads them to tolerate existing hierarchies.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>3.</strong> Hierarchies benefit the powerful — and they control the narrative.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Those at the top control media, education, and politics, shaping public opinion to justify inequality.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>4.</strong> Change takes time, and hierarchies resist it.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Systems are often set up to preserve themselves. Legal processes, political gridlock, and corporate inertia all slow down reform.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>5.</strong> People in power write the rules.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Laws, policies, and economic models are written by those already in control, often to protect their position.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>6.</strong> Historical systems leave long-term effects.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Systems like slavery, feudalism, and colonization created social hierarchies that still shape society through wealth gaps and social inequality.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>7.</strong> Economic dependence makes people compliant.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          People need jobs, housing, and healthcare. Challenging a system can feel risky if it puts basic survival at stake.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>8.</strong> Media normalizes inequality.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          News, shows, and ads often show hierarchy as natural — glamorizing the rich and ignoring or blaming the poor.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>9.</strong> Resistance is often punished.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Whistleblowers, protesters, and activists are often silenced, fired, or criminalized, discouraging others from speaking up.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li onclick="toggleFact(this)">
        🔹 <strong>10.</strong> People feel powerless to change the system.
        <div class="fact-detail">
          Hierarchies often make individuals feel like their actions don’t matter — reinforcing apathy and maintaining control.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
